== Automated posting to Blogspot

Now, Novelang build script automatically posts announcements of a new release to this blog.
This is a "Blogspot feature"
http://www.google.com/support/blogger/bin/answer.py?hl=en&answer=41452
: when mailing to some secret address (like
``novelang.announcer.reallysecret123456@blogger.com``) the mail becomes a blog post.
HTML works, and even picture embedding.

Since I use Novelang to draft all my postings (and emails), it's a logical step to write an "Ant"
http://ant.apache.org
task for automating the mandatory steps. Ant is a widespread scripting language. It comes with
a large set of handy features like loading a property file or sending an email.

How easy would it be? For text-only mails or blog posts, the task takes the URI of the Novelang
document to render. It returns two values in HTML or plain text: the title, and the body.
Ant supports multiple return values from a task, given the names of the properties to set
(a rudimentary concept of pointers).

For avoiding multiple web accounts it makes sense to use Google's Picasa. Picasa is the image
hosting service in which Blogspot saves attached images when posting by email.
But linking to images requires knowledge of their URL once Web-hosted.
With Picasa, an image URL is an unguessable thing like this:

<<<

>>>

The "Picasa Web Uploader API"
http://code.google.com/apis/picasa/docs/web_uploader.html
is quite confusing, because it describes the behavior of the PWU (Picasa Web Uploader) which
is a local d√¶amon, and leaves the "real" Picasa online somewhat in the dark.
So it's unclear how the HTTP response looks like, and how.
