== Status and history

Novelang is stable, with more thant 700 automated non-regression tests.

Bug fixing and documentation are first priority. Then come syntax enhancements. 
Defining a good syntax fitting for most use cases while allowing exceptions is a process 
on the long run. 
For this reason, syntax may change with no warning until version `1.0.0`.
