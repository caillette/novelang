--- Fixed : Book now display images correctly.

--- Fixed : Safari 4 did not render SVG resources when referenced from HTML document.

--- Fixed : HTML document now aware of SVG image dimension.

--- Slight change : ``n:pixel-width`` and ``n:pixel-height`` become ``n:image-width`` and ``n:image-height``, with measure unit if available. For raster images, it is always ``px`` unit.
