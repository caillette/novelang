     <h3>Abstract</h3>
<div>
     <p><a name="N9"></a>One of the main ideas of structured
languages (SGML and XML) is to separate structure and content from
presentation. XSL is the latest in a long sequence of both standardized
and proprietary solutions to this problem. Like DSSSL, and unlike FOSI
and CSS, XSL is a two step process model: transformation of the
original document and formatting of the transformed document. Unlike
DSSSL, the transformation aspect (separately approved as XSLT in a W3C
Recommendation stage in November 1999) has given rise to a significant
number of implementations. The much longer gestation of the formatting
object (FO) aspect of XSL has often led to questions of whether it was
even necessary. Now with the XSL-FO specification having attained PR
status, and with several public and commercial FO processors being
developed, it seems that FO will at least see the light of day. This
talk will first give a brief overview of the essential aspects of the
standard, and then discuss how XSL-FO tools will fit into the XML
landscape.</p>
     </div>
          <br><br>     <div class="section">
<a name="N10"></a>     <h2>Introduction</h2>
     <p><a name="N11"></a>In
this section, I'll describe XSL-FO and situate it with respect to the
more widely known XSLT specification. I'll give a very brief historical
overview of the development of the specification.</p>
     <div class="subsec1"><a name="N12"></a>       <h3>XSL, XSL-FO, XSL-T</h3>       <p><a name="N13"></a>       <b>
XSL</b>
       <a name="xsl"></a>
is the official name of the W3C specification (in the Proposed
Recommendation state at the time of writing) which describes a way of
attaching formatting information to XML documents  <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20071211215415/http://www.idealliance.org/papers/xml2001papers/tm/WEB/03-05-06/03-05-06.htm#bib.xsl"><img src="StateOfTheUnion%20Files/document.gif" border="0" width="30"></a>.      As described in its abstract, the specification consists of two distinct parts:      </p>
       <blockquote>       <p><a name="N14"></a>1. a language for transforming XML documents, and</p>
       <p><a name="N15"></a>2. an XML vocabulary for specifying formatting      semantics.</p>
       </blockquote>       <p><a name="N16"></a>Part 1, the <i>language for transforming XML documents</i>
 was      broken out of the XSL specification and was approved under the name of <i>XSL      Transformations</i>
 or <i>XSLT</i>
 in November 1999  <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20071211215415/http://www.idealliance.org/papers/xml2001papers/tm/WEB/03-05-06/03-05-06.htm#bib.xslt"><img src="StateOfTheUnion%20Files/document.gif" border="0" width="30"></a>.
XSLT is very widely used in applications which transform an XML
document into text, a different XML document, or perhaps most commonly
into an HTML document for delivery to a client browser.</p>
       <p><a name="N17"></a>To
avoid confusion with XSLT, the actual XSL specification which describes
formatting semantics is thus frequently referred to as <i>XSL-FO</i>
,      where <i>FO</i>
 is shorthand for <i>Formatting Objects</i>
.This specification      covers the following aspects of formatting:</p>
       <ul>
       <li>       <p><a name="N18"></a>the general formatting model</p>
       </li>
       <li>       <p><a name="N19"></a>the elements of the formatting language and their        relations</p>
       </li>
       <li>       <p><a name="N20"></a>the formatting properties which are applicable to each        element</p>
       </li>
       <li>       <p><a name="N21"></a>the expression language which may be used in specifying        property values</p>
       </li>
       </ul>
       <p><a name="N22"></a>In
this paper, I will use the term XSL to refer to the W3C specification
and the terms XSL or XSL-FO to refer to the vocabulary for formatting
semantics described by the specification. I will use the abbreviation <i>FO</i>
 to mean <i>formatting object</i>
.</p>

of the main ideas of using a structured language such as SGML or XML is
to separate structure and content from presentation. In the 15 years
since SGML was first approved as an ISO standard, there have been
several major attempts to create a companion standard which would allow
users to associate formatting information with structured documents.
One of the first standardization efforts resulted in the <b>
FOSI</b>
       <a name="N25"></a>
, developed by the U.S. Department of Defense, and adopted by Arbortext
and Datalogics to define stylesheets for SGML documents. The FOSI
defines an SGML vocabulary for attaching formatting characteristics to <i>elements in context</i>
. This fundamental concept is also the basic idea behind all other
formatting languages, although as we will see, it functions in a
slightly different way in XSL.</p>
       <p><a name="N26"></a>The next major attempt to resolve the problem was the ISO      standard       <b>
DSSSL</b>
<a name="dsssl"></a>  <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20071211215415/http://www.idealliance.org/papers/xml2001papers/tm/WEB/03-05-06/03-05-06.htm#bib.dsssl"><img src="StateOfTheUnion%20Files/document.gif" border="0" width="30"></a>.       <b>
DSSSL</b>
includes both a transformation and a formatting part. However, by the
time DSSSL was approved, the Web was becoming very important, and the
SGML community reacted by developing XML as a response to HTML. HTML
has built-in formatting semantics. Since XML, like SGML, doesn't imply
any formatting semantics, it can't be used for presentation without a
way of attaching formatting semantics to the elements. This quickly led
to the birth of the <b>
XSL</b>
 working group at the W3C.</p>
       <p><a name="N27"></a>Initially,
the XSL working group was composed of many of the same people who had
created DSSSL, and initial versions of the specification were heavily
influenced by DSSSL ideas, but using an XML syntax instead of Scheme
syntax. Like DSSSL, and unlike FOSI and <b>
CSS</b>
<a name="css"></a>, the XSL proposal was based on a two step process
model: transformation of the original document and formatting of the
transformed document. This is a crucial point for the history of XSL.
It led rather quickly to the split-off of the transformation
aspectâ&#8364;&#8220;more easily defined and agreed uponâ&#8364;&#8220;into the XSLT
specification. A number of critics considered at the time (and probably
still do) that this was an adequate answer to the problem. However work
on the main XSL specification continued, and the formatting property
set was brought closer to the CSS vocabulary  <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20071211215415/http://www.idealliance.org/papers/xml2001papers/tm/WEB/03-05-06/03-05-06.htm#bib.css"><img src="StateOfTheUnion%20Files/document.gif" border="0" width="30"></a>.</p>

     <div class="section">
<a name="N28"></a>     <h2>State of the union</h2>
     <p><a name="N29"></a>By <i>State of the union</i>
 I mean the actual content of Version      1.0 of the XSL specification. This will help to answer the question: <i>What      can I do with XSL?</i>
</p>
     <div class="subsec1"><a name="N30"></a>       <h3>Fundamental XSL concepts</h3>       <p><a name="N31"></a>If
you have experience with other formatting systems, XML-based or not,
various aspects of XSL may surprise you. This section describes some of
the main concepts underlying the specification.</p>
       <div class="subsec2">
<a name="N32"></a>       <h4>Formatting objects</h4>       <p><a name="N33"></a>The first fundamental idea is that XSL does <b>not</b>
provide a way of directly attaching formatting properties to elements
in an XML document. Instead it attaches formatting properties to <i>formatting      objects</i>
. These objects are defined by the XSL specification. For example,      instead of specifying typographic properties for a <code>title</code> element in a <code>subsec2</code> in the GCA XML2001 paper namespace, one transforms that into a <code>block</code> element in the FO namespace with particular typographic      properties.</p>
       <p><a name="N34"></a>Formatting
object processors therefore do not deal directly with elements of
various XML vocabularies, but only with elements of the formatting
object vocabulary. The principal elements in this vocabulary will be
described in <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20071211215415/http://www.idealliance.org/papers/xml2001papers/tm/WEB/03-05-06/03-05-06.htm#fovocab">fovocab</a>.</p>
       </div>
       <div class="subsec2">
<a name="N35"></a>       <h4>Transformation</h4>       <p><a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20071211215415/http://www.idealliance.org/papers/xml2001papers/tm/WEB/ts0/tp137.htm" class="topicInText">transformation</a><a name="N36"></a>This notion follows from the previous one: the formatting      object structure is (at least conceptually) the result of <b>transforming</b>
an XML document in a domain-specific vocabulary into the formatting
object vocabulary. This extremely powerful idea is a heritage from
DSSSL, although there are some subtle differences between the way DSSSL
and XSL are designed to function. The transformation may be quite
straightforward, in which case it is similar to simply attaching
formatting properties to elements in the original document, or it may
involve extensive generation of content, rearrangement or suppression
of existing content.</p>
       <h3>Note</h3>       <p><a name="N37"></a>It
isn't necessary to use the XSLT part of XSL to create an XML document
using the formatting vocabulary. Any other tool, including a standard
text editor, may be used to create such a document. However, in many
cases, the process will involve the use of XSLT. When it does so, the
formatting object document usually does not exist as a persistent
representation (for example, a file), but only as an in-memory
representation such as a <b>
DOM</b>
<a name="N38"></a> tree or a stream of         <b>
SAX</b>
<a name="N39"></a> events.</p>
              </div>
       <div class="subsec2">
<a name="N40"></a>       <h4>Areas</h4>       <p><a name="N41"></a>Formatting
objects are not themselves what one sees on a printed page or a browser
screen. Rather they are processed (by an FO processor) to create <i>areas</i>
. Areas are boxes which actually contain      laid-out content. A formatting object is said to <i>generate</i>
one or more areas. The size and position of the generated areas depends
on the constraints imposed by the formatting properties and the page
masters. For example, a block FO will generate more than one area if it
contains too much content to fit on a single page.</p>
       </div>
       <div class="subsec2">
<a name="N42"></a>       <h4>Writing-mode independence</h4>              <p><a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20071211215415/http://www.idealliance.org/papers/xml2001papers/tm/WEB/ts0/tp138.htm" class="topicInText">writing-mode</a><a name="N43"></a>Another
fundamental XSL concept is the notion of writing-mode independence,
which allows style sheets to be developed for non-Western writing
systems such as Hebrew, Arabic or Japanese. Again this idea comes from <b>
DSSSL</b>
. However XSL also retains the "absolute" model (top, bottom, left,
right) of specifying formatting properties, mainly to maintain
compatibility with the <b>
CSS</b>
 vocabulary.</p>
       <p><a name="N44"></a>Writing modes are specified using terms such as <code>lr-tb</code> or <code>tb-rl</code>. These codes specify the <code>inline-progression-direction</code> and the <code>block-progression-direction</code>. For example, lr-tb is interpreted as "lines of text are written from      left to right, and stacked from top to bottom". See <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20071211215415/http://www.idealliance.org/papers/xml2001papers/tm/WEB/03-05-06/03-05-06.htm#fig.wrtmode">fig.wrtmode</a> for an illustration of these terms.</p>
       <table border="1"><tbody><tr><td>
<a name="fig.wrtmode"></a>       <blockquote><i>
Writing mode</i></blockquote>
<p><i>       <p><a name="N45"></a>The figure on the left shows a Western writing mode; the        figure on the right shows the writing mode for Chinese.</p>
</i></p>       <blockquote><img src="StateOfTheUnion%20Files/03-05-06-fig02.png"></blockquote>

       </td></tr></tbody></table>
       <p><a name="N46"></a>Writing-mode
independence gives rise to a vocabulary for describing formatting
properties which uses different terms from those to which we (in
Western typography) are accustomed. For example, instead of specifying <code>left-indent</code> and <code>right-indent</code>, XSL has properties called <code>start-indent</code> and <code>end-indent</code>, where the terms <code>start</code> and <code>end</code>
are interpreted with respect to the writing direction for a line of
text. When writing a line of English text for example, we <i>start</i>
 at the      left and <i>end</i>
 at the right.</p>
       <p><a name="N47"></a>Similarly XSL uses the terms <code>space-before</code> and <code>space-after </code>rather than <code>space-above</code> and <code>space-below</code> when referring to space around blocks of text. Here, <code>before</code> and <code>after</code>
are interpreted with respect to the direction in which lines of text
(blocks) are stacked. When writing English, we proceed from top to
bottom, so <i>before</i>
 is above and <i>after</i>
 is below.</p>

       <div class="subsec2">
<a name="inheritance"></a>       <h4>Inheritance</h4>              <p><a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20071211215415/http://www.idealliance.org/papers/xml2001papers/tm/WEB/ts0/tp139.htm" class="topicInText">inheritance</a><a name="N48"></a>The XSL formatting model, like previous stylesheet languages,      makes extensive use of the notion of <i>inheritance</i>
. A formatting property which can be inherited may have its value set
on a high-level formatting object and the same value will apply to all
objects contained within that object. For example, font-related
properties such as family, size, weight and so on, are all inherited.</p>
       <h3>Note</h3>       <p><a name="N49"></a>The
containment relationships are defined by the hierarchy of the
formatting object "document" resulting from the transformation process,
which are <i>not</i>
 necessarily the same as those of the original XML        document.</p>
              </div>
     </div>     <div class="subsec1"><a name="fovocab"></a>       <h3>The formatting vocabulary</h3>       <p><a name="N50"></a>Bearing these concepts in mind, let's look at <i>Hello, world</i>
in XSL. The following example creates a single A4 page containing the
greeting, "Hello, world". Note that since no typographical formatting
properties are specified the default values will be used.</p>
       <table border="1"><tbody><tr><td>
<a name="N51"></a>       <blockquote><i>

    &lt;flow flow-name="xsl-region-body"&gt;
      &lt;block&gt;Hello, world&lt;/block&gt;
    &lt;/flow&gt;
  &lt;/page-sequence&gt;
&lt;/root&gt;</pre>       </td></tr></tbody></table>
       <p><a name="N52"></a>This example illustrates the basic structure of an FO document.      It consists of a <code>root</code> element which contains a single <code>layout-master-set</code> and one or more <code>page-sequence</code> elements. The <code>layout-master-set</code> defines all page masters and sequences of page masters. It must contain      at least one <code>simple-page-master</code> element. A <code>page-sequence</code> contains the actual content of the document which will be placed on      pages, enclosed in a <code>flow</code>. The flow contains one or more block-level elements, of which the most      common is simply <code>block</code>.</p>
       <p><a name="N53"></a>In the rest of this section, I'll look at this structure in more      detail, expanding on the example as I go along.</p>
       <div class="subsec2">
<a name="N54"></a>       <h4>Page and page-sequence masters</h4>       <p><a name="N55"></a>The
formatting vocabulary allows the user to define a number of page
masters, each of which defines the size, orientation, margins, and body
and side region placement. In the example above, the master named <i>simple</i>
defines an A4 page with 2 cm. side margins and 3 cm. top and bottom
margins and a single column of body text. Different masters may define
pages of different sizes, with different margins and different numbers
of columns.</p>
       <p><a name="N56"></a>Each <code>page-sequence</code> object references either a single <code>simple-page-master</code> object or a <code>page-sequence-master</code> object, using the <code>master-reference</code> attribute.       </p><p><a name="fn.master"><i>Note</i></a>: </p><a name="fn.master"></a>         <p><a name="N57"></a>The name of this property was changed from <code>master-name</code> to <code>master-reference</code> between the Candidate and Proposed Recommendation versions.</p>
        The <code>page-sequence-master</code>
object serves to group together references to different
simple-page-master objects and to define the order and rules governing
their use. This allows typical recto/verso pagination styles as well as
more complex sequences to be designed. If a page-sequence directly
references a simple-page-master, that master is used to generate as
many pages as necessary to hold all of the content of the flow. If the
page-sequence references a page-sequence-master, page masters from that
sequence are used to generate the pages which hold the content.<p></p>
       <p><a name="N58"></a>Each simple-page-master defines a <code>region-body</code>
and up to four optional regions which are placed on each side of the
region-body. The region-body is generally used to hold the content of
the flow object while the side regions are used to hold the content of
any <code>static-content</code> objects present in the page-sequence.
This static content is repeated on each page generated by a master
containing the corresponding region. For example, if we want to extend
the Hello world example to include a running head with the text "FO
examples" and a footer with the page number, we would use the following
document.</p>

<a name="N64"></a>       <h4>Flow content</h4>       <p><a name="N65"></a>Let's look in more detail at the content of a <code>flow</code>. I've used the term <i>block-level FO</i>
several times without precisely defining it. A block-level FO is one
which generates areas which are stacked in the same way as lines of
text; this is called the <i>block-progression-direction</i>
. For Western languages it is top to bottom. So far, our examples have
shown only one kind of block-level FO, which is called <code>block</code>. It is by far the most common FO; it can be used to format titles,      paragraphs or long quotes. </p>
       <p><a name="N66"></a>The
other block-level formatting objects are essentially containers which
arrange their child block-level FOs in particular ways. The following

: the visual representation corresponding to that character code. The
size of this inline area is determined by the current font-related
characteristics. <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20071211215415/http://www.idealliance.org/papers/xml2001papers/tm/WEB/03-05-06/03-05-06.htm#fig.textarea">fig.textarea</a> shows inline areas generated by text.</p>

fixed, proportional or automatically calculated widths, defining header
and footer rows and specifying one or more table bodies. Row and column

provided. <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20071211215415/http://www.idealliance.org/papers/xml2001papers/tm/WEB/03-05-06/03-05-06.htm#fig.table">fig.table</a> illustrates the areas generated by the      table-specific formatting objects.</p>
       <p><a name="N85"></a>One
extremely important point to make concerning tables is that using the
transformation language, table-style formatting may easily be applied
to an input XML document which is not modeled as a table. This can be a
liberating experience for DTD and Schema designers!</p>

       </td></tr></tbody></table>
       <p><a name="N86"></a>The list model consists of the <code>list-block</code> which simply acts as a container for <code>list-item</code> FO. Each list-item has <code>list-item-label</code> and <code>list-item-body</code> children, as shown in Figure <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20071211215415/http://www.idealliance.org/papers/xml2001papers/tm/WEB/03-05-06/03-05-06.htm#fig.list">fig.list</a>. The content of      both the <code>list-item-label</code> and the <code>list-item-body</code>
is one or more block-level formatting objects. This means that even if
your list-item-label contains only a number or a bullet, you must
enclose it in a <code>block</code> FO. The relative positioning of the
label and the body areas is controlled by the indent values specified
on each one. Like all indents, these are interpreted with respect to
the reference area and not to the areas created by the list-item or
list-block formatting objects.</p>

<a name="N87"></a>       <h4>Out-of-line formatting objects</h4>       <p><a name="N88"></a>The XSL formatting vocabulary also contains two distinct      formatting objects, <code>footnote</code> and <code>float</code>, with <i>out-of-line</i>
 or <i>floating</i>
 behavior. The float FO can      be used to produce both <i>before</i>
 and <i>side</i>
 floats, depending on the      value of its <code>float</code> attribute. If the value is <code>before</code>,
the float is placed in the "before side" (corresponding to the top in
Western writing-mode) of the region-body containing the anchor. If the
value is <code>start</code>, <code>end</code>, <code>left</code>, or <code>right</code>,
the float is called a side-float and is placed on either the start or
end side of the region-body, depending on the value specified.
Depending on the values specified for indents on the float and normal
flow content, side floats may intrude on normal content in the
region-body, forcing it to "run around" the floating area or be
positioned in the margin like a sidenote.</p>

       <div class="subsec2">
<a name="N89"></a>       <h4>Formatting properties</h4>       <p><a name="N90"></a>The XSL formatting vocabulary includes a large number of      <i>properties</i>
. Some properties are specific to certain formatting objects while
others are applicable to a large number of objects. In addition to
standard typographical and pagination-related properties, XSL includes
many properties related to audio presentation, and some properties
useful for electronic media.</p>
       <p><a name="N91"></a>Print-oriented formatting properties can be broken into several      main groups:       </p><ul>
         <li>         <p><a name="N92"></a>font and character related, including hyphenation        properties,</p>
         </li>

         </li>
         <li>         <p><a name="N94"></a>borders, padding and background,</p>
         </li>
         <li>         <p><a name="N95"></a>area size, position and alignment,</p>

         </li>
       </ul>
<p></p>
       <p><a name="N98"></a>Properties determine the size and
placement of the areas which are generated by formatting objects. They
also determine how they will be rendered. In order to use XSL
effectively, you need to understand how the FO processor uses
properties. It is particularly important to see how <code>start-indent</code> and <code>end-indent</code> determine the placement of the text in a block FO.      <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20071211215415/http://www.idealliance.org/papers/xml2001papers/tm/WEB/03-05-06/03-05-06.htm#fig.blockprops">fig.blockprops</a>
shows the relation of the indent properties to border and padding
properties. Note that indents are measured with respect to the
containing <i>reference area</i>
. In a normal flow, each column of text in the region-body is a
reference area, but table-cells, block-containers and inline-containers
also define reference areas. A reference area allows the writing-mode
to be changed, so that it is possible to mix different writing modes on
the same page. </p>

some formatting properties are inherited while others are not. The
value of an inheritable property for a given formatting object is found
by looking at that object and each of its ancestors in turn until a

processor. The version as of October 2001 is 0.20.2. FOP has fairly
complete support for the expression language and partially supports
most of the major formatting objects, but is rather weak in overall
page layout logic involving keep conditions and floats. It supports
PDF, PostScript, PCL, MIF and plain text rendering, as well as a Java
AWT preview function. However, the renderers offer varying degrees of
functionality, with PDF and PCL being the most complete. FOP uses
Apache Batik for its SVG processor. FOP can be used either directly
with XML files in the FO namespace or with input XML and XSL files. It
uses the <code>javax.xml.transform</code> pluggable interface so that
it may be used both with any compatible XSLT processor when doing
transformations. It may be used either as a command line application or
embedded in an application or a servlet. FOP is integrated into several
other projects, such as Cocoon and X-Smiles. For more information,

<a name="N113"></a>       <h4>RenderX XEP</h4>       <p><a name="N114"></a>XEP
is a commercial formatting object processor available from RenderX,
Inc. The version as of October 2001 is 2.5. It is written in Java and
implements a complete formatting processor which can produce PDF and
PostScript output. It offers support for most of the print-oriented
formatting objects defined in the XSL Proposed Recommendation, with
limitations in certain cases. It has limited support for the XSL
expression language and very limited support for SVG when used in the <code>instream-foreign-object</code> FO. See <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20071211215415/http://www.renderx.com/"></a>
 for complete information      concerning the capabilities, evaluation version and commercial version of      XEP.</p>

     </div>     <div class="subsec1"><a name="N115"></a>       <h3>XSL-FO and browsers</h3>       <p><a name="N116"></a>There
seems so far to be little interest in using XSL-FO directly in
browsers, despite the fact that certain aspects of the specification
are aimed at creating style sheets for online use. One might evoke a
number of reasons for this: processing power, browser politics, and the
pervasive use of XSLT to transform XML into HTML on either the server
or client side. This section briefly imagines why one would want to
have an XSL-capable browser and what would be involved in building one.</p>
       <div class="subsec2">
<a name="N117"></a>       <h4>Motivation</h4>       <p><a name="N118"></a>One
motivation is to be able to get original XML data closer to the
destination and thus to be able to process it in intelligent ways
without going back to the server to retransform it into new HTML. In
some cases, simply applying CSS formatting directly to the XML may
offer sufficient functionality. In other cases, the transformation
capability of XSL is necessary to achieve the desired result,
particularly if one wants to produce a tabular representation of data.</p>
       <p><a name="N119"></a>An
XSL-enabled browser would also make it possible to achieve correct
printed results on the client side based on the original XML and a
print-oriented stylesheet. The current alternative is to produce PDF on
the server using an XSL-FO engine and then send that PDF to the client.
The PDF file is almost always larger than the input XML and XSL files,
which is problematic on slow networks.</p>
       </div>
       <div class="subsec2">
<a name="N120"></a>       <h4>Some technical issues</h4>       <p><a name="N121"></a>XSL-based
layout is currently quite an expensive operation, involving parsing of
the original XML document, transformation and then formatting of the
resulting document structure. When using a streaming architecture the
memory requirements can be quite large. When using XSL in the browser
view, it would have to be possible to dynamically recompose the entire
formatting object hierarchy whenever the window size changed. On the
plus side, it is considerably easier to lay out a single conceptually
infinite column (or <i>galley</i>
) of text rather than dealing with page and column-breaking issues,
floats and so on. For example, in a browser view, out-of-line objects
could be shown in pop-up windows.</p>
       <p><a name="N122"></a>In
order to enable dynamic scripting access to the DOM of the original
document, the areas creating by the formatting process must maintain
references to nodes in that tree. Although the transformation process
clearly makes this more complicated than, for example, simply applying <b>
CSS</b>
formatting to XML objects, it does not make it technically impossible.
This depends on coordination between the various XML processing tools
involved; current public interfaces do not provide sufficient
information to implement such coordination.</p>
       </div>
       <div class="subsec2">
<a name="N123"></a>       <h4>A first attempt: X-Smiles</h4>       <p><a name="N124"></a>The open source project X-Smiles      <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20071211215415/http://www.x-smiles.org/"></a>
is creating an XML browser in Java. The X-Smiles project has ambitious
goals. It aims to support XSLT and XSL-FO processing as well as SVG and
<b>
SMIL</b>
<a name="N125"></a>, while continuing to maintain Java 1.1
compatibility and a small footprint! This project currently (version
0.3) uses a slightly modified version of the Fop AWT rendering backend
to support the XSL formatting specification in its browser. X-Smiles
also provides EcmaScript capabilities in its browser, but the current
architecture makes that impossible for the moment for the XSL-FO part.</p>
       </div>
     </div>     </div>
     <div class="section">
<a name="N126"></a>     <h2>Looking forwards</h2>
     <p><a name="N127"></a>As
we've seen, XSL-FO is still largely uncharted territory. Assuming that
the specification will be blessed as a W3C Recommendation in the near
future, final barriers to the development and use of XSL processors for
print media should fall. There is already high interest in the user
community as evidenced by the number of "newbie" questions in fora such
as the Fop mailing list. The fact that users are willing to struggle
with incomplete products and changing specifications for months at a
time would seem to indicate a pressing need for producing high-quality
print output from XML.</p>
     <p><a name="N128"></a>A final thought:
those users are located all over the world. Even in today's "globalized
economy", the printed word is still a primary vector of communication.
The XSL specification gives users everywhere the tools to write
stylesheets for their XML documents. But in order to realize XSL's
promise of writing-mode neutral formatting, XSL processors need to
address those features of the specification more fully than they do
today. And tomorrow, perhaps the browsers will follow suit!</p>
