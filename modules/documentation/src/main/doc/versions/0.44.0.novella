--- Renamed Part into Novella and Book into Opus. Nicer, clearer. New recommended file suffixes are ``.novella`` and ``.opus``. Old ``.nlp`` and ``.nlb`` suffixes still supported.

--- Switched build system from Ant to Maven. Because all jars stand in the ``lib`` directory, this impacts the command line for launching Novelang.
