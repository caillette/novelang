== Script for renaming to new extensions

Here is a Bash script (tested on Mac OS X) that renames every
``.nlp`` into ``.novella`` and ``.nlb`` into ``.opus``.
It also changes file content. Use with care.

<<<
#!/bin/sh

SED='s/\.nlp/\.novella/g;s/\.nlb/\.opus/g'
for file in `find src modules \( -name *.nlp -o -name *.nlb \) `
do
  newfile=` echo "$file" | sed $SED `
  echo "$file -> $newfile"
  sed $SED < $file > $newfile
  rm $file
done
>>>
