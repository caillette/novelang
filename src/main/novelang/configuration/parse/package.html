Parsing stuff for command-line arguments.
The {@code DaemonParameters} and {@code BatchParameters} classes provide a clean way to access
to an array of {@code String}s with very basic checks.
No default value are set. File existence is checked for directories but when the value is not
mandatory, it is left to null or an empty collection.
