These are tests for Novelang-logger-slf4j project.
This project is a better place because it has Novelang-vanilla-fixture as
a dependency, which involves the logback-test.xml resource. 
The logback-test.xml resource can't ship with Novelang-logger-slf4j (maybe
it could appear as a duplicate in Novelang-logger-slf4j's test resources).
So here is finally a better place.
