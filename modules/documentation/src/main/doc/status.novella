== Release notes 


=== Meaning of the version number

Version number has the "Major, Minor, Fix" form.
Before Novelang reaches version `1.0.0`, a change in "Minor" means a new feature.
A change in "Fix" means a bugfix, while retaining compatibiliy with documents and stylesheets.

Release notes do report when there is a possible compatibility break with existing documents and
stylesheets.
