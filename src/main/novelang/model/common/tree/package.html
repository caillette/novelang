Generic Tree manipulation API basing on immutable structures.
<p>
  The {@link novelang.model.common.tree.Tree} interface defines the simplest contract
  for a tree structure.
  It only holds an indexed list of children and has no backpointer to any parent,
  making each {@code Tree} instance shareable by other {@code Tree}s.
</p>
<p>
  The {@link novelang.model.common.tree.ImmutableTree} abstract class provides default
  implementation of a {@code Tree}.
</p>
<p>
  The {@link novelang.model.common.tree.TreeTools} utility class provides utility methods for
  creating mutated copies of a {@code Tree}.
</p>
<p>
  Because {@code Tree} instances may be children of other immutable {@code Tree}s, the parent
  of an "updated" {@code Tree} must be "updated" itself through a similar copy-on-change
  mechanism.
  The {@link novelang.model.common.tree.Treepath} class represent the "parenthood" of
  a {@code Tree} to be updated.
</p>
<p>
  {@code Treepath}s are immutable structures, too.
  The {@link novelang.model.common.tree.TreepathTools} utility class provides utility methods
  for "updating" {@code Tree}s inside a {@code Treepath},
  which implies "updating" the {@code Treepath}.
</p>

<h3>
  Discussion: where to define utility methods?
</h3>
<p>
  The {@link novelang.model.common.tree.ImmutableTree} and
  {@link novelang.model.common.tree.Treepath} classes implement a well-defined, minimalistic
  behavior. All copy-on-change mechanisms can be made external to those classes
  (thanks to the {@link novelang.model.common.tree.Tree#adopt(Tree[])} method).
  So we have {@link novelang.model.common.tree.TreeTools} and
  {@link novelang.model.common.tree.TreepathTools} holding all other useful-but-not-central
  methods. Keeping the contracts as clear as possible is the priority.
</p>
<p>
  Yes, static method calls are a bit longer: without static imports, one has to write
  something like <tt>TreepathTools.method(treepath)</tt> instead of <tt>treepath.method()</tt>
  which looks more more object-oriented, by the way.
  If codewriters using this package want the more concise approach,
  they <em>could</em> subclass {@link ImmutableTree} and add instance methods wrapping a call
  to the corresponding utility method (by the way {@code Treepath} is final by now).
</p>
<p>
  TODO: extend the contract of {@link novelang.model.common.SyntacticTree},
  and add the wrapper in both
  {@link novelang.model.common.SimpleTree} and {@link novelang.parser.antlr.CustomTree}.
