--- New ``--temporary-dir`` option. For better error messages, Novelang HTTP DÃ¦mon now renders
the whole document before sending it to the HTTP client. If the document is really big, it goes in
a temporary directory (and gets deleted immediately).

--- Fixed SVG embedding for PDF. Now the image appears as true vector image inside the PDF.
Correct reference to the SVG resource implied adding a ``$content-directory`` parameter
passed to XSL stylesheets.

--- Fixed loss of request parameters when issuing error page.
